```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Reshape
```{r reshape}
summary(cars)
```

### my example
```
reshape(data = rcads_p,
direction = "long",
varying = c("rcads1_p", "rcads2_p", "rcads3_p"),
times = c("rcads1_p", "rcads2_p", "rcads3_p"),
v.names = "score",
timevar = "var",
idvar = "id"
)
```

### memo
- x needs to be in the alphabetical order but include non-varying and varying
- varying needs to be in order of v.names and alphabetical
- varying nees to be entered by time
- Include other variables in x
